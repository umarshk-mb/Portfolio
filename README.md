<!--# Portfolio
-> Personal portfolio the name of this website is Apnawebsite and the purpose that I decided to work on this website is to showcase my work and my interest towards the technology. 

-> Basically this website is developed using html, css, js, angular and material ui.  

->And my motivation behind this project is to work on fundamentals of angular which I had learnt during my internship.

-> And broken into 5 components such as Home page, About sec, projects, skills and contact form. And we can navigate b/w different components on a single click. Which is done using routing technique in angular.   

-> This project improves user experience because of single page app and material ui. And I have included my resume and different social media platforms so that the visitors can get in touch with me.   

-> And finally in this website I had added 4 live projects such as random quote generator, YouTube clone, Netflix clone and movie ticket booking app. And this is my interesting project that I worked on till now.
